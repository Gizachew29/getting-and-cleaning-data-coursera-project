#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
### By: Trent Parkinson

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The original data set was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

This repository contains the following:

- 'README.md', which provides an overview of the project and data set
- 'CodeBook.md', which describes the conents of the data set (data, variables, and transformations)
- 'run_analysis.R', an R script that was used to download the original data and create the 'tidy_data.txt'
- 'tidy_data.txt', contains the final data from 'run_analysis.R'
